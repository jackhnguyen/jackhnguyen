## Good day everyone **(‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ)**
Hi guys I'm currently working through the UCI [ICSSC fellowship](https://fellowship.icssc.club/course/unit1/) to learn more about web development. My goal is to learn the basics that includes, html, css, js, react, and move onto next.js so that I can make my own applicaitons. If you have any cool resources for me I'd be so down to look into it.
